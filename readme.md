Pythagoras' theroum
===================

Pythagoras' is taught at an early stages of most people's introduction to mathematics.
It is so well known that many people can name it from sight alone. Show them the
forumlae and they will recognise it immediately:

> a<sup>2</sup> = b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>

It describes the ratios of the lengths of the side of a right angled triangle.
In the equation:

- `a` is the length of the hypontenuse (longest side opposite the right angle)
- `b` and `c` are the lengths of the other two sides respectively.

Calculating the length of a side
--------------------------------

If the lengths of two sides are known, then the equation can be used to
calculate the length of the other side.

For example, if a right angled triangle has a hypothenuse that is 9cm long,
and another side that is 3cm long, we can rearrange the formula to
calculate the length of the other side:

> c = $`\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}`$
